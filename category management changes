  Future Rule consideration:
  --------------------------

 1.Primary and Secondary Associations
We can consider pulling in object data based on primary or secondary associations.

POs based on Commodities
Suppliers based on preferred Commodities
Contracts based on the Supplier's preferred Commodities
Sourcing Events based on the winning Supplier

Mapping Associations Setup (R28+)
----------------------------------

We can consider allowing customers to map an object to Commodities, Suppliers, or both (and in the future may have additional objects to make associations to as well)..  For example, if a customer would like PO spend data to come from the Commodity and not the Supplier, they can set it up to do so.

'Category' Custom and System Fields (R28+)
------------------------------------------
In the future we would like to consider creating a new type of 'Category' Custom Field that can be added to objects.  This way a customer can set up the Category Custom Field on the Project object, for example, and explicitly set the value, per Project.

We can also make it a system field, allowing them to make a first class association but as a standard part of the process, as well.
